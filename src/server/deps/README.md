# Dependencies for server
To compile the server you need to have the [botan](https://github.com/randombit/botan) library, to compile it. run the `configure.py` in Botan's repository then simply run `make` or any other command used for Makefiles, paste the generated includes located in `build/include` in Botan's **built** repository in `src/server/deps/include` in this repository. And paste the generated `.lib`/`.a`/`.so` in `build/` in Botan's **built** repository to `src/server/deps/lib` in this repository. You might need to supply the `configure.py` some arguments incase you're crosscompiling or the compiler you're using does not have the same architecture as your system.
